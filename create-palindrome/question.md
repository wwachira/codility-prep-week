# Create Palindrome

Write a function solution that, given a string S of length N, returns any palindrome which can be obtained by replacing all of the question marks in S by lowercase letters ('a'−'z'). If no palindrome can be obtained, the function should return the string "NO".
A palindrome is a string that reads the same both forwards and backwards. Some examples of palindromes are: "kayak", "radar", "mom".
Examples:

1. Given S = "?ab??a", the function should return "aabbaa".
2. Given S = "bab??a", the function should return "NO".
3. Given S = "?a?", the function may return "aaa". It may also return "zaz", among other possible answers. The function is supposed to return only one of the possible answers.

Assume that:

-   N is an integer within the range [1..1,000];
-   string S consists only of lowercases letters ('a' − 'z') or '?'.
-   In your solution, focus on correctness. The performance of your solution will not be the focus of the assessment.
