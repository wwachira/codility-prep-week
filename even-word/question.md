# Even Word

In an even word, each letter occurs an even number of times.
Write a function solution that, given a string S consisting of N characters, returns the minimum number of letters that must be deleted to obtain an even word.
Examples:

1. Given S = "acbcbba", the function should return 1 (one letter b must be deleted).
2. Given S = "axxaxa", your function should return 2 (one letter a and one letter x must be deleted).
3. Given S = "aaaa", your function should return 0 (there is no need to delete any letters).

    Write an `efficient` algorithm for the following assumptions:

    N is an integer within the range [0..200,000];
    string S is made only of lowercase letters (aâˆ’z)

`acbcbba -> aabbbcc -> aabbcc -> b -> 1`
`axxaxa -> aaaxxx -> aaxx -> ax -> 2`
`aaaa -> aaaa -> 0`
